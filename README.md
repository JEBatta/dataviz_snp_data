# dataviz_snp_data
This code was created to buildt individual phenotype data visualizations for each patient which participated in the first stage of the project CONACYT FRONTERAS DE LA CIENCIA: COMPLEJIDAD Y SALUD. UN ENFOQUE DESDE LAS CIENCIAS DE LA COMPLEJIDAD (2015-02-1093).
The aim of the project is to create a comprehensive database with predictors that could increase the risk of obesity prevalence in a population of Mexican adults.
Part of the variant phenotype of some participants were obtained to be included in the database, as well as blood chemistry data and anthropometric information. Part of the comprimise with participants was to give them back a summary of their phenotype information.

I wrote this code to create this images in an automated way. It was writen in Mathematica. The original database is not given due to confidentiality. An example of a visualization is provided.
